# üîë Cybersecurity box database

This repository aims to **store** every training box that was created by PoC's cybersecurity team (wheter it be on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com), or any other third-party service -even [Pathwar](https://github.com/pathwar/pathwar)!).

## How does it work?

Each box is filed in the appropriate website folder: for example, you can browse TryHackme boxes in the [TryHackMe folder](./TryHackMe/). The boxes still in development are -you guessed it- in the [indev folder](./indev/).

> [!WARNING]  
> It is not useful nor recommended to download the whole repository. You're more likely to only need a specific box, and you can do so using the [download-directory](https://download-directory.github.io/) website.

### Usage

Since each box structure can be fundamentally different from one another, from virtual machines to a simple trivia, they all have *at least* two READMEs in their directory:

- An explanation on how to get the box working. If the box has been published on a website, a link to its page will be provided.
- A write-up of the box. If there are multiple, there will be a folder named "write-ups" or something similar.

If a box does not meet these requirements, you may want to file an **issue**. But before that, make sure to check out the next section.

## Get involved

You're invited to join this project! Adding boxes, write-ups or requesting subjects ideas is greatly appreciated. Check out the [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before filing any issue or pull request.
